ok
so
um
what
I'm
going
to
do
is
walk
through
the
consent
form
with
you
i
haven't
done
this
with
a
human
being
yet
ok
and
then
i'll
go
through
the
questions
and
you
know
we
can
do
that
for
like
a
half
hour
or
whatever
until
we're
like
bored
and
want
to
stop
um
and
you
can
answer
the
questions
i'll
i'll
phrase
them
so
that
they're
like
applicable
to
you
ok
so
you
don't
need
to
like
try
to
figure
out
i'll
just
be
asking
questions
about
you
basically
um
so
here's
the
consent
form
ok
thank
you
so
much
for
being
willing
to
meet
with
me
i
really
appreciate
it
of
course
this
is
basically
just
official
documentation
from
the
university
that
ensures
that
i'm
not
like
taking
advantage
of
you
to
get
an
interview
from
you
i
also
see
this
as
sort
of
a
way
of
holding
me
accountable
and
giving
you
resources
in
case
something
happens
that
you
aren't
comfortable
with
or
you
want
to
follow
up
about
so
that
stuff's
on
the
back
page
and
we'll
get
to
that
in
a
second
let's
start
with
number
one
um
the
purpose
of
the
study
the
purpose
of
this
study
is
to
examine
the
motivations
goals
and
experiences
of
relocators
and
whether
or
how
these
change
over
time
you
are
being
asked
to
participate
in
this
study
because
you
qualify
as
a
relocator
and
or
were
a
participant
in
the
2010
relocation
study
conducted
with
George
Fox
University
this
study
includes
and
builds
off
that
interview
data
by
signing
this
consent
form
you
agree
to
the
use
of
your
2010
interviews
for
this
study
if
you
have
any
questions
about
that
data
or
would
like
to
see
a
transcript
please
let
me
know
and
i
will
provide
it
ultimately
this
interview
data
as
well
as
the
stuff
from
2010
um
may
be
used
for
academic
audiences
such
as
for
publication
which
is
what
i've
talked
about
with
you
about
my
thesis
um
as
well
as
for
public
audiences
for
example
in
theory
a
workshop
on
relocation
etc
in
such
a
case
your
anominity
anonymity
will
be
carefully
removed
ok
so
then
number
two
um
well
do
you
have
any
questions
about
that
first
part
[katie
too
quiet
can
i
...]
no
alright
um
so
this
study
is
sort
of
finished
within
a
year
starting
this
summer
into
next
your
participation
really
involves
just
this
interview
which
is
about
two
hours
the
interview
takes
place
at
a
time
a
place
of
your
convenience
after
i've
reviewed
the
our
conversation
and
transcribed
it
i
will
reach
out
to
you
again
to
offer
a
follow-up
interview
which
is
totally
voluntary
only
if
you
want
to
do
it
you
can
do
it
in
person
or
over
video
chat
or
not
at
all
it
doesn't
matter
but
you
will
have
an
opportunity
to
connect
with
me
again
about
this
so
if
you
do
at
that
time
i
will
kind
of
share
with
you
what
i'm
noting
from
the
interview
and
how
i'm
kinda
thinking
about
proceeding
and
you
can
give
me
your
thoughts
about
that
um
and
then
finally
again
if
you
want
i'm
happy
to
send
you
a
copy
the
final
text
before
i
submit
it
for
publication
there's
no
expected
cost
with
this
study
number
three
um
and
we
don't
really
anticipate
much
inconvenience
for
you
besides
the
cost
of
this
time
right
that
we're
spending
of
which
i'm
very
grateful
um
there's
no
unforeseen
risks
and
there's
no
compensation
in
case
you're
injured
the
positive
effects
that
might
result
from
this
study
are
basically
the
possibility
to

um
have
a
more
enriched
understanding
of
relocation
the
benefits
for
you
moving
onto
the
next
page
is
basically
there's
no
guarantee
of
benefits
for
you
um
but
i'm
hopeful
that
this
time
to
reflect
on
your
experience
is
at
least
a
positive
experience
for
you
number
eight's
not
applicable
and
number
nine
there's
no
compensation
for
your
participation
at
this
point
i've
applied
for
a
grant
and
will
apply
for
one
more
grant
um
in
the
case
that
i
got
that
grant
i
would
be
able
to
give
you
a
small
monetary
fee
for
participating
would
be
about
like
twenty
dollars
um
which
isn't
a
lot
but
if
i
got
i
would
love
to
give
that
to
you
thank
you
for
being
willing
to
do
this
without
being
paid
um
number
ten
i
don't
anticipate
any
reason
i
would
need
to
withdraw
you
from
this
study
um
if
you
choose
to
withdraw
yourself
at
some
point
um
you
can
totally
do
that
there's
no
problem
you
can
stop
answering
questions
whenever
you
want
to
during
this
interview
alright
so
then
i
what
i
think
is
most
important
information
on
this
number
twelve
um
this
is
not
my
cell
phone
but
my
faculty
advisor
doug
perkins
so
if
something
happens
today
that
you're
uncomfortable
with
or
you
feel
was
unprofessional
or
inappropriate
